Low-threshold potassium channels and a low-threshold calcium channel regulate 
Ca2+ spike firing in the dendrites of cerebellar Purkinje neurons: a modeling 
study. 
Brain Res 891:106-115 

The mosinit.hoc file generates traces similar to figure 2 in the paper.
It takes about 5 minutes to generate this figure on a 800 MHz Win 2000 PC.

The model adopted De Schutter and Bower's model as the starting point, 
then modified the descriptions of several ion channels, such as the P-type 
Ca channel and the delayed rectifier K channel, and added class-E Ca 
channels and D-type K channels to the model. Our new model reproduces most
of our experimental results and supports the conclusions of our 
experimental study that class-E Ca channels and D-type K channels are 
present and functioning in the dendrites of Purkinje neurons.
See above paper for more details and references.
